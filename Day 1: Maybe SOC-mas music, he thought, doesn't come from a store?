What this PowerShell command does:

    The -ep Bypass -nop flags disable PowerShell's usual restrictions, allowing scripts to run without interference from security settings or user profiles.
    The DownloadFile method pulls a file (in this case, IS.ps1) from a remote server (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MM-WarevilleTHM/IS/refs/heads/main/IS.ps1) and saves it in the C:\\ProgramData\\ directory on the target machine.
    Once downloaded, the script is executed with PowerShell using the iex command, which triggers the downloaded s.ps1 file.

If you visit the contents of the file to be downloaded using your browser (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MM-WarevilleTHM/IS/refs/heads/main/IS.ps1), you will see just how lucky we are that we are not currently using Windows.
